# Self-Supervised Learning with Barlow Twins and CIFAR-10

---

This project implements the [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230) method for self-supervised learning on the **CIFAR-10** dataset. It then utilizes the learned representations from a **ResNet50** backbone (trained from scratch) to train a new supervised classification model. A comprehensive report detailing the implementation and providing **evaluation metrics** for the trained model will be included.
