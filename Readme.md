# Self-Supervised Learning with Barlow Twins

---

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the [Barlow Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03230) for self-supervised representation learning using a ResNet-50 backbone on CIFAR-10. It covers data augmentation pipelines, model training, and visualization of training metrics. Additionally, it includes linear evaluation, achieving an accuracy of **62%** when fine-tuning a linear classifier using only **10%** of labeled data from CIFAR-10.
